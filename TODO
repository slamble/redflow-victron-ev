Miscellaneous things that probably should be done at some point.

 - Modify to query load on L2 and L3, not just L1.
 - Modify to handle more than one battery in the system.
 - Query the ZBM using Modbus rather than the JSON REST API. (Mostly
   to reduce the number of third party libraries this script relies on.)
