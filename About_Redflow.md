# About Redflow

[Redflow](https://www.redflow.com/) manufactures zinc bromide hybrid flow batteries. They are sized to store 10 kWh of
energy, with a peak discharge rate of 5 kW, and a sustained discharge rate of 3 kW. The
battery management system (BMS) for a Redflow battery will operate with a [Victron](https://www.victronenergy.com/) energy
system, and have recently added the capability to operate with [Deye](https://www.deyeinverter.com/) hybrid inverters.

## Advantages

Zinc bromide is inherently fire resistant; you simply won't get a runaway thermal reaction
in the way that you will with some lithium chemistries. There is also no concern about
discharging too deeply; you don't need to have a reserve of energy to protect the battery.

In addition, zinc and bromine are abundant on Earth. There is very little concern about
supply - certainly at a far lower level than concern about lithium, and the other materials
that are used to make a lithium battery (such as cobalt or phosphorous, the latter of which
is also needed for farming.)

## Disadvantages

The main disadvantage of a Redflow battery is that it undergoes a maintenance cycle every
three days. All energy stored in the battery is discharged, and then the battery anodes
are chemically stripped of all material. During the strip process, the battery is unavailable
to store or release energy. Most Redflow installations have at least two battery modules
installed to counter this disadvantage.
